# CREATING STRAP SERVER WILL CREATE A NEW FOLDER CALLED "SERVER". ADD IT TO .GITIGNORE
#
# Initializing strapi would have created a bunch of collections in our mongodb
#   - users
#   - more metadata collections 
#   - we'll add more for our use case using strapi admin ui (which in turn will create them in mongodb)
#
# Start strapi as: cd server; strapi start
#   - Create a new user
#   - Create new "model types"
#   - Give permissions to "Public" & "Authenticated" to query our mongodb
#
# GraphQL
#   - Install graphql plugin using the marketplace
#   - Play around with graphql at http://localhost:1337/graphql
#

#
# Stripe install as: 
# cd  client; npm install react-stripe-elements (needed for frontend)
# cd server; npm install stripe (needed for strapi)
# Log in to stripe and get test api keys (publishable key, secret key)
#
